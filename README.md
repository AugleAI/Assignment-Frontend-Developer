# Frontend Developer Assignment

As part of our application process, we'd like to see what you can produce by giving you a small assignment. It should take you no more than a few hours to complete the assignment, but any extra polish or features you might want to put in will not go unnoticed.

## Problem Statement

We would like you to create a simple Dashboard for Attendance Management. The dashboard should have following features - 
- A side-navigation bar to access other pages on the site. Though you only have to implement the home page. Others can be left blank.
- A component having details about the building or cafe. 
- A component providing overall statistics in numbers. No graphs required. 
- 2 simple tables containing information about employees who requested for manual attendance, and for the employees having high temperature. 

An image of a potential UI for dashboard is provided in this repository for reference. You need not implement every detail in the image, though should focus on above features. Your backend can be anything, and does not have to work. Even static data in code is ok. The icons also need not be exactly the same. You can use whatever you can find easily. 

You can use any framework you like, but React will be favourable, as our current product is built using that.


## Requirements - 

- Code should have highly reusable components
- Web Page should be responsive for different devices
- Should work perfectly in Chrome, Firefox, Microsoft Edge. 


Take your time but try to deliver it within 2 days (by end of Thursday). It just need to have UI components, you don't need to implement any functionality. Let us know if you need extension. If you have any questions, please ask!

To complete your homework, please fork this repo and commit your work to your fork. When you are ready for us to look at it, give us access to your fork (OzoneX, tHeMaskedMan981) so we can review and run it(Add instructions in the README). You can also mail us with the link of github repository. Also, if possible, deploy it to any online platform (eg. Netlify) and share itâ€™s link in the README of your fork.
